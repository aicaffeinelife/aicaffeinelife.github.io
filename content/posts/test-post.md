This is a first test post testing out various features avaialble in the theme. 

First, let's take a basic line equation $y = mx + c$. The slope $m$ defines the direction of the line in 2d space and $c$ is a constant from which line starts when $x = 0$. Although unintersting, lines have many uses like:


- give an idea about the direction of a parabola
- join two points together :D


Statistics: Expectation of a random variable $X$ is defined as $\mathbb{E}(X) = \int x p(x)  dx$ where $p(x)$ is the probability distribution of $X$ and $x$ is the possible values $X$ can take. If $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
