# Hi! I'm Ankit


Hi! Welcome to my blog. I'm Ankit, a research scientist at Fujitsu Research. My main areas of interest are machine learning algorithms and quantum computing. I investigate and develop machine learning algorithms to help scale quantum computers to beyond small system sizes. Maybe in the future they'll actually be useful, who knows? 


In the meantime, I am dedicated to exploring some research topics that I find interesting and occasionally post musings on what I often think about on my long walks (that's my secret hobby lol). 

Beyond work and research, you can always find me in a gym or curled up with a good novel. I also play the piano and love to solve puzzles in spare time. Give me a holler if you like (or don't like) in my posts. 

## My Skills 

- Languages: Python (primarily), Cython, Bash, CUDA/C (don't use it very often)
- Frameworks: Pytorch, JAX (love it!), Tensorflow
- OS: Linux, Windows, MacOS 



## Life Updates 

- Jan'24: Started position at Fujitsu Research
- Mar'24: Moved to CA! Land of Eternal Sunshine and high taxes lol
- Dec'24: Got a beautiful Mazda CX5 :grinning:
